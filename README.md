# Windows UK Apple Keyboard Layout

Created using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134)

Layout specifically for the Apple A1243 Wired Keyboard with Numeric Keypad (British) but may work with other Apple keyboards.

Pair it with [this AHK script](https://gist.github.com/jf908/aeb5a3e420f23cf78aaa13ba2f780097) to get the â‚¬ and # on Alt+2 and Alt+3.
